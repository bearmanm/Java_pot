<h1>Our Story - Welcome to thetshirt.company</h1>
<p>Thanks for dropping by! You know those dramatic backstories you hear about filled with tough parents,
hard times, and a sprinkle of chaos? <br/> Well, I've got one of those, but spoiler alert: mine has a pretty uplifting twist you'll hear by carrying on reading!</p>

<p>At 11 years old, I found myself in a children's home. Now, before you get your tissues out, let me reassure you it wasn't all gloom and doom.<br/>
  For sure, school wasn't exactly smooth sailing, and street smart savy quickly became my second language. But what did I really take away from that chapter? </p>
<p>Well.. Determination. Pure, stubborn determination that became the cornerstone of who I am today.</p>

<p>Fast forward 22 years, and there I was, working at one of the biggest global entertainment companies, when someone decided to casually drop this wisdom bomb on me:<br/> 
  "Some people just aren't built to be coders." and "You probably don't have what it takes to become successful."
  Did I take that lying down? <br/> 
  Nope! Instead, those words became fuel for my inner fire, rocket fuel, actually. And I decided, right then and there, 
  to turn those negative vibes into a full-on, coding adventure and find something to build to help,me learn how to write code.</p>
  <p>Add that to my creative side, my passion for sketching stuff.. And this is it.. Wa La! thetshirt.company was born.</p>

<p>So every web page you click into, every piece of code written to make this website work, every single t-shirt design you see here at thetshirt.company yep, that's all me.<br/>
  Each design is handcrafted with determination, caffeine, and plenty of 
  "I can totally do this" moments. Mistakes? yep Loads... Lessons? Even more... Satisfaction? Off the rictor scale!</p>

<p>But let's pause here for one moment!... <br/> 
  Because honestly, none of this journey would matter one bit without my rock, my best friend, my amazing wife, Amy.<br/>
  We met at just 13 years old, two curious kids navigating life's twists and turns. Amy had her own unique challenges too.<br/> 
  Picture this: parents moved away, brother in charge, yeah, life can be quirky, right? 
  But through every twist and turn, Amy has been my anchor, patiently listening to my endless boring coding rambles ("Honey, watch this.. it works!").<br/>
  But the point is, through thick and thin she has stayed by my side to make this possible</p>

<p>So, here's the takeaway, the heart of why thetshirt.company exists: no matter where you come from, no matter what people say you can't do use it. Use it all as fuel.<br> 
  Turn every "no" into your "watch me." And remember, it's always better with someone you love by your side.</p>

<p>Welcome to thetshirt.company 
  I hope you find inspiration here, and maybe your new favorite t-shirt!</p>

<p>You could have the same determination too,<br/>
  Mike (and Amy!)</p>
